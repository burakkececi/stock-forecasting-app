# Stock-Forecasting

## Project Overview:
In finance, stock (also capital stock) consist of all the shares by which ownership of a corporation or company
is divided. 1 A stock exchange is an exchange (or bourse) where stockbrokers and traders can buy and sell shares
(equity stock), bonds, and other securities. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This
makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. 2 Stock prices are dependent on a lot of
external factors therefore there is no clear rules for forecasting prices. But even with their volatile nature forecasting,
with correct price visualization and statistical modeling, helps investors decide on which stocks to invest for better
returns.

In this project a web application, ML models will be developed for the purpose of
visualizing and forecasting stocks.
